Hey! I'm **Kadu**, a Brazilian developer who's lived across the globe — China, Spain, Germany — and currently based in **Santiago, Chile**.

I work on multiple projects across the UK, Germany, and Spain, so free time is rare. But when I get it, I build stuff.

## Currently Focused On

**[ralph-vibe](https://github.com/whatiskadudoing/ralph-vibe)** — Autonomous development with Claude Code. More than a philosophy. More than vibe coding.

## Tech

TypeScript · React · Next.js · Node.js · Swift · GraphQL · and much more
